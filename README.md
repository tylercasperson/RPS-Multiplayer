# Rock Paper Scisosrs Online Game

### Here is the link to the live website: [Rock Paper Scissors Online Game](https://tylercasperson.github.io/RPS-Multiplayer/)

I was really excited for this assignment. A few weeks prior, my instructor had asked us to challenge ourselves to create a single person rock paper scissors game in class. We were only given 30 min. I wanted to include the single player mode in this proejct. I looked online for good comics and reashed out to the Rock Paper Scissors orginization which allowed me to use their images. There are some really good rock paper scissors games out there. I hope you enjoy playing this version of Rock Paper Scissors!
